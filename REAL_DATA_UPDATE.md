# Real Blockchain Data Integration

## What Changed

The app was showing **FAKE mock data** everywhere. Now it shows **REAL data from YOUR wallet** and the deployed smart contracts on Fluent Testnet.

## Pages Updated

### âœ… `/profile` - Your Real Profile
**Before:** Showed fake name "Alex Chen" with fake stats  
**After:** Shows YOUR wallet address with REAL on-chain data:
- Real completed jobs count from `SkillRegistry` contract
- Real average rating calculated from blockchain
- Real verified skills count
- Your actual wallet address (not someone else's!)

### âœ… `/skills` - Real Skill Management  
**Before:** Showed 10 fake skills with fake verification status  
**After:** Shows 10 predefined skills that YOU can verify on-chain:
- Real verification status from `SkillRegistry` contract
- **Actual blockchain transactions** when you click "Verify On-Chain"
- Connects to your wallet to write to the smart contract
- Each verification costs gas and creates a real transaction

### ðŸŽ¯ `/my-projects` - Coming Soon
Will show real jobs from `JobEscrow` contract

### ðŸŽ­ `/marketplace` - Stays Mock (Intentionally)
This page keeps fake job listings so testers can see what potential jobs look like

## How It Works

### Real Blockchain Integration

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Uses RainbowKit + Wagmi
   - Connects to YOUR actual wallet
   - All data is specific to YOUR address

2. **Smart Contract Reads**
   - Hooks query the deployed contracts
   - Data comes from Fluent Testnet blockchain
   - Real-time updates when transactions confirm

3. **Smart Contract Writes**  
   - "Verify Skill" button sends REAL transactions
   - Costs actual gas (testnet ETH)
   - Updates are permanent on-chain

## New Custom Hooks

### `useUserProfile()` 
Located at: `hooks/useUserProfile.ts`
- Fetches reputation data from `SkillRegistry` 
- Returns completed jobs, total rating, average rating
- All data is **read from blockchain**, not fake

### `useUserSkills()`
Located at: `hooks/useUserSkills.ts`
- Checks verification status for 10 predefined skills
- Each skill hash is calculated: `keccak256("Skill Name")`
- `verifySkill()` function sends real transaction to blockchain
- Shows loading states during transaction confirmation

## Smart Contracts Used

### SkillRegistry  
`0x0b6a6a6b2837f8CC1888744CCEB5ead11185b192`
- `getUserReputation(address)` - Get your stats
- `isSkillVerified(address, skillHash)` - Check skill status  
- `verifySkill(skillHash, proof)` - Verify a skill on-chain

### SkillVerifier (WASM)
`0x310500eAda15912a87B0Ff773287392F92eD6E28`
- Called by SkillRegistry for verification logic

## User Experience

### No Wallet Connected
- Shows "Connect Your Wallet" message
- No fake data displayed
- Clear call-to-action

### Wallet Connected
- Shows YOUR address
- Displays YOUR on-chain data
- All stats are REAL numbers from blockchain
- Can interact with contracts (verify skills)

## What's Real vs Fake Now
