# SkillChain üîó

> A decentralized freelance marketplace where your skills are verified on-chain and your reputation follows you everywhere.

Built on [Fluent Network](https://fluent.xyz) - the first blended execution blockchain that runs both Rust and Solidity smart contracts together.

## What is this?

SkillChain is like Upwork or Fiverr, but better:
- Your skills are verified on the blockchain (not just self-reported)
- Payments are automatic and trustless through smart contracts
- Your reputation is permanent and can't be faked
- No middleman taking huge cuts

## Cool Features ‚ú®

- **Real Skill Verification**: Prove your skills on-chain with cryptographic proofs
- **Browse Jobs**: 20+ freelance opportunities across blockchain, design, and development
- **Smart Escrow**: Clients fund milestones, freelancers get paid automatically when approved
- **Your Wallet = Your Profile**: Connect once, your reputation follows you
- **Blended Contracts**: Uses both Rust (for heavy computation) and Solidity (for state management)

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- RainbowKit + Wagmi (wallet connection)

**Smart Contracts:**
- **Rust/WASM**: SkillVerifier, EscrowCalculator (complex logic)
- **Solidity/EVM**: SkillRegistry, JobEscrow, PaymentManager (state management)

**Network:**
- Fluent Testnet (Chain ID: 20994)

## Quick Start üöÄ

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/GoJackzi/SkillChain.git
cd SkillChain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect your wallet!

| Contract | Type | Address |
|----------|------|---------|
| SkillVerifier | WASM | `0x310500eAda15912a87B0Ff773287392F92eD6E28` |
| EscrowCalculator | WASM | `0x4eb45D68d9eBB1c5E8a5D8aA546c4B034B4b32A0` |
| SkillRegistry | Solidity | `0x0b6a6a6b2837f8CC1888744CCEB5ead11185b192` |

## Why Fluent? üåä

Fluent is the only blockchain where you can run **Rust** and **Solidity** contracts side-by-side. This means:
- Use Rust for complex calculations (cheaper gas!)
- Use Solidity for familiar EVM contracts
- They talk to each other seamlessly
